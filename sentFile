4) From home directory, directory CIS163 was modified in the last three days.
5) The output from the "ls -lt" command list all of the files in order of last modification. The most recently modified files start first. The Music directory has not been updated the longest. It was updated on August 31.
6) Output from command "ls -ltc" lists the files in order of most recently changed file status information/properties. The directory CIS163 had its file status info./props. modified today.
7) Output from command "ls -ltu" displays the most recent access dates of each file. CIS 163 directory has most recently been accessed.
8) Selecting "CIS163" directory file, command "stat CIS163" outputs the following:

10) In the home directory, entering the two commands: "echo Line one > out.txt" and "echo Line two >> out.txt" creates a new file named "out.txt" with the text "Line one\nLine two".
The link count to this file is 1. After creating a hardlink (alias) of the file by typing "ln out.txt out-alias.txt" the link count changes to 2.
11) The size and content of the original file and the created alias are the same. The "cat filename" command is used to see the content of a file.
12) After removing the file "out.txt" using the "rm" command, the link count is changed to 1 for the alias. the content of the alias is the same as the original file.
13) A "hard link" is just an additional name for an existing file.
14) Creating a soft link with the command "ln -s out-alias.txt sym-alias.txt", the link count of the two files is both at 1.
15) The command "ls -l out-alias.txt sym-alias.txt" displays all the information for both files. The symbolic link starts with as 'l' in the filetype string, while the original file starts with '-'. In addition, the file size for the link is smaller.
16) After deleting the file "out-alias.txt", and then typing "cat sym-alias.txt" an error message resulted: "No such file or directory".
17) A soft link only directs you to a file, while a hard link is like a copy of a file. A hard link may go to the actual location in memory, so it can still may be accessed after being "deleted".
18) The command "id" allows you to see which default group you belong to (listed in the middle). I belong the the "users" group for my default.
19 and 20) Changing the directory to the root Unix directory and entering "ls -l": the user and group owner for all directories, files, and links are "root". The third group of 3 characters lists the permissions for those who arn't part of the group or user of the file. This included myself. I don't have any access to the "root" directory. I can create a new file in the "tmp" directory.

10) In the home directory, entering the two commands: "echo Line one > out.txt" and "echo Line two >> out.txt" creates a new file named "out.txt" with the text "Line one\nLine two".
The link count to this file is 1. After creating a hardlink (alias) of the file by typing "ln out.txt out-alias.txt" the link count changes to 2.
11) The size and content of the original file and the created alias are the same. The "cat filename" command is used to see the content of a file.
12) After removing the file "out.txt" using the "rm" command, the link count is changed to 1 for the alias. the content of the alias is the same as the original file.
13) A "hard link" is just an additional name for an existing file.
14) Creating a soft link with the command "ln -s out-alias.txt sym-alias.txt", the link count of the two files is both at 1.
15) The command "ls -l out-alias.txt sym-alias.txt" displays all the information for both files. The symbolic link starts with as 'l' in the filetype string, while the original file starts with '-'. In addition, the file size for the link is smaller.
16) After deleting the file "out-alias.txt", and then typing "cat sym-alias.txt" an error message resulted: "No such file or directory".
17) A soft link only directs you to a file, while a hard link is like a copy of a file. A hard link may go to the actual location in memory, so it can still may be accessed after being "deleted".
18) The command "id" allows you to see which default group you belong to (listed in the middle). I belong the the "users" group for my default.
19 and 20) Changing the directory to the root Unix directory and entering "ls -l": the user and group owner for all directories, files, and links are "root". The third group of 3 characters lists the permissions for those who arn't part of the group or user of the file. This included myself. I don't have any access to the "root" directory. I can create a new file in the "tmp" directory.

10) In the home directory, entering the two commands: "echo Line one > out.txt" and "echo Line two >> out.txt" creates a new file named "out.txt" with the text "Line one\nLine two".
The link count to this file is 1. After creating a hardlink (alias) of the file by typing "ln out.txt out-alias.txt" the link count changes to 2.
11) The size and content of the original file and the created alias are the same. The "cat filename" command is used to see the content of a file.
12) After removing the file "out.txt" using the "rm" command, the link count is changed to 1 for the alias. the content of the alias is the same as the original file.
13) A "hard link" is just an additional name for an existing file.
14) Creating a soft link with the command "ln -s out-alias.txt sym-alias.txt", the link count of the two files is both at 1.
15) The command "ls -l out-alias.txt sym-alias.txt" displays all the information for both files. The symbolic link starts with as 'l' in the filetype string, while the original file starts with '-'. In addition, the file size for the link is smaller.
16) After deleting the file "out-alias.txt", and then typing "cat sym-alias.txt" an error message resulted: "No such file or directory".
17) A soft link only directs you to a file, while a hard link is like a copy of a file. A hard link may go to the actual location in memory, so it can still may be accessed after being "deleted".
18) The command "id" allows you to see which default group you belong to (listed in the middle). I belong the the "users" group for my default.
19 and 20) Changing the directory to the root Unix directory and entering "ls -l": the user and group owner for all directories, files, and links are "root". The third group of 3 characters lists the permissions for those who arn't part of the group or user of the file. This included myself. I don't have any access to the "root" directory. I can create a new file in the "tmp" directory.
